# Snake And Ladder
Practice project for System Design. Problem statement is attached as a File.

## Short-comings:
1) playerList and Dice should not be part of board.
2) A separate service for Dice rolls
3) A separate service for Player moves
4) A different strategy for dice roll which is called by dice-service
5) Snake and ladder can be a subclass of Another class as they have similar properties.

### Sample Input File has input as: 
1) No of Snakes followed by start,end pair
2) No of Ladders followed by start,end pair
3) No of Players followed by their names
